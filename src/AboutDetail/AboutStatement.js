      <h1>About Physics Baby</h1>

      <p>
        I flunked out of Middle School in Hong Kong back in 2009 and 2010, because I was not mentally prepared
        to commit to my education with intensity. For various reasons, the opportunity came
        that my family has decided perhaps uprooting me to the U.S. can help with my education
        and is worth a gamble. Just like that, I moved to San Francisco with only my dad, and my mom stayed in HK.
      </p><br /><p>
       Back in 2010, I struggled to speak English, and being placed in an all-immigrant high school did not help
       with acculturation either. In 2014, my acrobatic endeavor somewhat came to an end after competing as part of Team USA, 
       and the real culture shock occured to me when I was at a Community College. 
      </p><br /><h2>
        It wasn't until 2017 that I realized I wanted to pursue a STEM degree.
       </h2><p>
        In 2014-2015 I was not prepared for college, in part due to a cultural shock (immigrant issue).
      </p><p>
        In 2015-2016, I went on a gap year, my dad decided to fully move back to Hong Kong, and I had to partially support myself that point on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2016-2017 I decided to take college more seriously. I was on track for Kinesiology, and it required a chemistry class.
      </p><p>
        In 2017-2018, I took a preparatory courses in Chemistry on track for Kinesiology in hopes to finish the degree, but then realized that
        studying Chemistry and taking exams were somewhat rewarding, and the act of self-teaching/learning was also fun. it was out of sheer enjoyment
        that I decided to change my major to one of STEM discipline. 
      </p><br/><p>
        While I did take some detours before realizing that I wanted to pursue a major of STEM discipline, I was not exposed to 
        Differential Calculus until in 2018. Since 2018,
        my decision to pursue a major in STEM-discipline solidified, and gradually I decided to go with Physics. In total, I spent 5.5 years to
        finish the UC Transferrable courses for a bachelor's degree, and 2.5 years spent on college-preparatory courses. (I know it took me a long time!)
        But I also think that it is not impossible for someone to start all over again from ground zero. I don't think that one's placement test
        can dictate a person's future endeavor. My Bachelors of Science in Physics is proof of that.  
      </p><br /><p>
        As a non-traditional student, with a complete 180 turn in both personality,
        and college major/career paths, I realized to myself that my immigration
        had an expected impact of unpredictable outcomes. One of the biggest and most unexpected
        change is that I become somewhat of a nerd, and I am kind of proud of it;
        One thing that did not change is that I am still driven
        by what I am passionate about, and am actively pursuing it.
      </p><br /><p>
        I am creating this website to document 
        everything that I have learned through the skills that I have gained from studying physics. 
        Some of it is my attempt to bridge the details that lecture may have missed out on from the 
        perspective of a student as well as preparation for Physics GRE, some of it is just my own 
        learning for fun. I don't know what this website can do for me, nor do I have any idea just 
        what this website can blossom into, but I'm devoting this amount of effort at least to document 
        the things I have learned in hopes that one day, someone else can find the documentation/materials 
        available on this website to be useful.
